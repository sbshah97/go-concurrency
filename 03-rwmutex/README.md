## RWMutex

* Differentiates between read and write access.
* Multiple goroutines can hold read locks simultaneously, but only one can hold a write lock.
* Allows more concurrency for read-heavy workloads.

**Optimized Concurrent Reads with RWMutex**

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure you have Golang installed. Follow the official installation instructions at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install): [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Executing:**

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the `main.go` file.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

**Output:**

You'll observe multiple lines of output, including:

- **Read count in the loop:** These lines show the count being read concurrently at different points in time.
- **Final count:** The final count will consistently be 100, indicating successful synchronization.

**Key Points:**

- **RWMutex for Enhanced Read Performance:** The code explores `sync.RWMutex` for efficient handling of concurrent reads and writes.
- **Read Locks for Simultaneous Reads:** Multiple goroutines can acquire read locks (`RLock`) simultaneously, enabling parallel reads without blocking each other.
- **Write Locks for Exclusive Writes:** Write operations (`Lock`) require exclusive access, preventing both reads and writes to ensure data consistency.
- **WaitGroup for Goroutine Coordination:** The `sync.WaitGroup` synchronizes the main function with all goroutines, ensuring completion before printing the final count.

**Next Steps:**

- Experiment with different read/write ratios to observe RWMutex's performance benefits in read-heavy scenarios.
- Explore advanced synchronization techniques like channels and atomic operations for specific use cases.
- Dive deeper into Go's memory model and best practices for building scalable and reliable concurrent applications.
