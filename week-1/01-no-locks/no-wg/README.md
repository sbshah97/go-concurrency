# Race Conditions and the Need for Synchronization

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure you have Golang installed. Follow the official installation instructions at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

**Executing:**

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the `main.go` file.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

**Output:**

You'll observe multiple lines of output, including:

- **Read count while writes are happening:** These lines reflect the count's value as it's being modified concurrently, potentially leading to inconsistent results.
- **Final count:** This final count might be less than 1000 due to race conditions.

**Key Points:**

- **Race Conditions:** The code demonstrates how multiple goroutines accessing a shared variable without synchronization can lead to race conditions and unexpected results.
- **Synchronization Necessity:** It highlights the importance of using synchronization mechanisms like mutexes to ensure consistent data access in concurrent scenarios.

**Next Steps:**

- Modify the code to implement a mutex for proper synchronization and observe the corrected output.
- Explore other concurrency primitives like WaitGroups and RWMutex for different synchronization needs.
- Learn more about Go's concurrency model and best practices to write safe and efficient concurrent code.
