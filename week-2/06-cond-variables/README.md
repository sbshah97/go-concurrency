## Cond: Condition Variables for Signaling and Waiting

* Utilizes `sync.Cond` for signaling and waiting in a synchronized manner.
* Enables coordination and communication between concurrent goroutines.
* Useful for scenarios where explicit signaling is required.

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure you have Golang installed. Follow the official installation instructions at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Executing:**

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the `main.go` file.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
Output:

The program will output the final count after using condition variables to signal and wait for certain conditions.

## Key Points:

* sync.Cond for Signaling: Condition variables are used to signal and wait for specific conditions.
* Mutex for Mutual Exclusion: A mutex (sync.Mutex) is employed to protect the shared variable.
* WaitGroup for Goroutine Coordination: The sync.WaitGroup ensures all goroutines complete before displaying the final count.

## Next Steps:

* Explore advanced use cases for condition variables in concurrent programming.
* Experiment with different conditions and signaling mechanisms.
* Consider other synchronization primitives provided by the sync package for specific scenarios.
