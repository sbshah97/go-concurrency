## Context: Canceling Groups of Goroutines Gracefully

* Uses Go context to gracefully cancel groups of goroutines.
* Enables proper cleanup and termination of concurrently executing goroutines.
* Demonstrates how to coordinate cancellation across multiple goroutines.

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure you have Golang installed. Follow the official installation instructions at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Executing:**

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the `main.go` file.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
Output:

The program will display the final count after canceling the context and stopping all goroutines gracefully.

Key Points:

Context for Cancellation: Utilizes Go context to signal cancellation to goroutines.
Graceful Termination: Goroutines check for context cancellation to exit gracefully.
WaitGroup for Goroutine Coordination: The sync.WaitGroup ensures all goroutines complete before displaying the final count.
Next Steps:

Explore other features of the Go context package for advanced use cases.
Consider using context values for passing data to goroutines in a cancellable way.
Experiment with different cancellation signals and timeouts.
